The total budget for the district is $24,649,428.

The average math score across the district is approximately 78.98, and the average reading score is approximately 81.87.

About 74.98% of students passed math, 85.80% of students passed reading, and 65.17% of students passed both.

#School Summary

The budget allocated per student varied between schools, the range is from $585 to $680.

Charter schools generally had higher average math and reading scores than District schools.

Large schools (from 2000 to 5000 students) had lower average scores in both compared to medium (from 1000 to 2000 students) and small schools(less than 1000 students).

#Conclusions

There's a difference in performance between Charter and District school students. Charter schools have higher scores and a higher percentage passing rate. This suggests that Charter schools may have a more conducive way to help students' academics.

In this analysis, a higher per-student budget does not necessarily translate into better academic performance. Some schools with lower per-student budgets (like Cabrera High School) outperformed schools with higher per-student budgets (like Huang High School). This indicates that student performance might be influenced more by how resources are utilized rather than how much resources are available.
